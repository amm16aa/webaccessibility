        <p>Lets start by explaining what an accessibility design is and what features it must have. 
          Accessibility defines users’ ability to use products/services, but not the extent to which they can 
         attain goals (usability). User experience designers should create output accommodating the needs of all 
          potential users, be they disabled (e.g., color-blind users) or anyone facing situational barriers
           (e.g., being forced to multitask). 
           Making the Web more accessible for users with various disabilities is to a great extent a matter of 
           using HTML the way it was intended: to encode meaning rather than appearance. As long as a page is 
           coded for meaning, it is possible for alternative browsers to present that meaning in ways that are 
           optimized 
           for the abilities of individual users and thus facilitate the use of the Web by disabled 
           users.</p>
           <p>Auditory Design: People who are deaf or have other auditory disabilities rarely have problems on the Web since sound 
           effects are usually totally gratuitous. The usability of a site almost always stays the same when 
           the sound is turned off. With the trend toward more multimedia this is not going to remain the case, 
           though. In particular, transcripts should be made available of spoken audioclips and videos should 
           be made available in versions with subtitles 
           (which will also benefit users who are not native speakers of the language used in the video).
