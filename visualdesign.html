        <p class="lead">When designing a website, it is important to consider certain design choices in order to make the website accessible for those who suffer with some sort of disability. One way to make your website more accessible is to focus on your visual design choices. Visual design choices can help make your website easier to us for those who may suffer with some sort of visual disability or a certain environmental factor.</p>

        <p>One visual design choice to focus on when creating a website is color. Since there are people who suffer from certain visual impairments that make it hard to see specific colors or contrasts between them it is important to pick the colors that you use wisely. Color should be used to complement or hughlight what is already being portrayed on the website. You should also use colors that are bold and contrats against each other so the words are easy to read on the screen.</p>

        <p>Another visual design choice to consider using on a website is the size of certain elements on the website. There are many people who do not have the best vision, so it is important that the words and images on your website are easy to see even for the people with bad vision. This problem can easily be fixed by making the font size of your wording larger and the images larger also so that someone isn't straining their eyes trying to see what is being said or shown.</p>

        <p>Lastly, another important visual design choice to focus on are the linking elements. Links are often used within paragraphs on a website as an interactive element. One way to make these links stand out from all of the oter words on the website is to make them a different color. You can also use the hover effect so that people who are color blind can can their mouse over the page and wit for the cursor to change so that they know they are hovering over a linked element.</p>

        <p>By considering all of the visual design choices that you could make when designing a website, it will be easy to end up with a website that is closer to being fully accessible for those with disabilities.</p>
